<h1> Rachel Holton-Burnett Week 6 Read Me </h1>
<p> I had a lot of difficulties with the second part of this assignment. I know that it's not complete but I don't understand how to connect the final page to the main page. I tried
several things but I could not get anything to work. I feel like I need to create an if statement that when the count is equal to ten it changes the page to print the name,age and final score but I couldn't get it ironed out. </p>
