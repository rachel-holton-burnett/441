<h1> Read Me - Rachel Holton-Burnett </h1>

<p> I had main struggles with this homework assignment. The first one was making sure that I was creating something visually pleasing. I love
contrasting colors so and the hero image I used has great contrast so I wanted to include that in the colors I chose. However, this made the information and hobbies sections difficult to read. So I needed to find another color for my box while still be visually pleasing. The second, and biggest issue, that I had was getting
all of my code to be accurate. At first I was having a hard time with the site linking to the style sheet. I couldn't figure out what was wrong and ended up
just starting over and referring to a past homework assignment to figure out the issue. I also referred to the example a lot to determine what items I needed in the style sheet. I had a hard time getting the box to be the correct width and couldn't figure it out! I don't know why my paragraphs are falling outside of my text boxes.
