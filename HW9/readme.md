<h1> Rachel Holton-Burnett Week 9 Read Me </h1>
<p> I could figure out how to make the links appear as the images they are linked to. I feel like I tried everything including using the website instead of creating a local JSON, using a href (and href) on the JSON. I tried to google it and read several websites but none explained how to make it turn from exact text to the actual link. </p>
