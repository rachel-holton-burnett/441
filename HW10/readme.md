<h1> Rachel Holton-Burnett Week 10 Read Me </h1>
<p> I had more difficutlies with this project than any others. I tried so many things to change my x and y value but I could not figure out. My script is on my HTML file. I started doing that instead of using the JS file because I was having such a hard time with it that I just wanted all of the code in front of me. I know that this isn't even close to being finished but I'm not going to make any more progress on it so I wanted to turn it in.  </p>
