<h1> Read Me Assignment 5 </h1>
<h2> Rachel Holton-Burnett </h2>
<p> Even though this assignment had several moving parts it made a lot of sense. I did have a hard time getting the table to be 5 rows across
and it took me a little bit of time to figure that out. It also took me some time to figure out how to make each of my 5 pictures appear
but I then realized that I needed to change the variable count. I am looking forward to the next step in this project! </p>
