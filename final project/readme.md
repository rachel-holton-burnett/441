<h1> Rachel Holton-Burnett Final Project Read Me </h1>
<p> I had a lot of difficulties with my if/else statements. I couldn't get it to reset, I tried setTimeout several different ways but it wouldn't turn it back over to being the animal picture for me to try again. For one moment I got it to work if you clicked the wrong animal picture but once again, I couldn't get it to reset so I figured it would be best to leave it as is. I also tried to put the images in an array instead of listing them all out and coudn't get the count right. I think that probably would have helped me in the long run because I could have had it reset back to it's count in the array and been able to match the array with the questions. </p>
