<h2> 441 Assignment 3 </h2>
<p> This week I wasn't sure that I understood the instructions based on the lecture so I'm hoping that I completed the assignment correctly. All of the information on the lecture made sense I just wasn't sure how to actually apply it. I couldn't figure out how to have my document write items be in a list until I realized that I need to put the < li > inside the quotation marks. I am looking forward to adding onto this assignment.
