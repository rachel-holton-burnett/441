  <div id= "question">
      <p>Tavish was out hiking deep into the wilderness. She had been on the trail for about 5 miles and she hadnâ€™t seen another person for about 3 miles. She figured she was the only human around. As she continues to hike, she unexpectedly comes across a small stream which she crosses. There is then a very steep decline, as she is going down this hill, she hears something and sees rustling in a near bush. She can see that about 20 yards in front of her the trail forks. To the right will lead her right to the rustling bush and to the left she can continue down the trail avoiding what might lie ahead.  <br>
She pauses for a moment to decide what to do. <br> <br>

Should she: </p>
