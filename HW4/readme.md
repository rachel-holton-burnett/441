<h2> Rachel Holton-Burnett's HW 4 </h2>
<p> This project was really difficult for me to complete. It was hard to think about both sections that need to be updated. Once I got the hang of that it made more sense but for some reason I had trouble with choice 4. When I would copy/paste choice 3 and change out the tags to choice 4 it broke almost the entire site. It was like it had an extra bracket or closed tag but I couldn't find it. Once I hand typed it out, it worked. I'm still not sure what caused it but I am relieved that it's working now.
